## Technical Overview
The **Application Validator Tool** is developed using PowerShell and Windows Forms for the graphical user interface (GUI). The tool takes input for server names and application names and validates the installation status remotely.

### Key Components:
- **PowerShell Scripting**: Handles backend operations such as connecting to servers and checking installed applications.
- **Windows Forms**: Constructs the graphical interface that users interact with.
- **Application Validation**: Uses PowerShell commands to verify if the specified applications are installed on the target servers.

## Credential Management
The tool allows users to enter credentials securely for server access. These credentials are temporarily stored in `C:\temp` during the session and cleared immediately after clicking *Clear* or closing the tool. This ensures secure handling of user credentials.

## Export and Print Capabilities
The tool includes options for exporting and printing validation reports:
- **Export to Excel/PDF/CSV**: Save the validation results in various formats for record-keeping and audits.
- **Print**: Provides an option to print the results for physical documentation.

## FAQ

- **Q1: Can I add multiple applications at once?**  
  **A1**: Yes, you can list multiple applications in the 'Enter Applications Name' field, separated by commas.

- **Q2: What types of applications can this tool validate?**  
  **A2**: The tool can check for any installed applications, as long as it has the necessary permissions on the target servers.

- **Q3: Is this tool compatible with non-Windows servers?**  
  **A3**: Currently, the tool is designed to work only in Windows-based environments.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Issue: Results are not displaying after pressing CHECK.**  
  **Solution**: Ensure the server names and application names are entered correctly and that you have network access to the servers.

- **Issue: Unable to connect to a server.**  
  **Solution**: Verify that the server is online, and check that you have the necessary permissions and credentials to access it.
